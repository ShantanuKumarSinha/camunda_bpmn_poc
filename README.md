# Camunda BPMN with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL

This application is to showcase how to use camunda bpmn

### What is Camunda?
    Camunda is an open-source platform for workflow and decision automation. It provides a suite of tools
    for modeling, executing, and monitoring business processes using BPMN. Camunda allows you to define
    business processes in a standardized way and execute them in a scalable and reliable manner.

### What is BPMN?
    BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a standard for business process modeling that
    provides a graphical representation of business processes. It is designed to be easily understandable by all stakeholders, including business analysts, technical developers, and business managers.

### What is Spring Boot?
    Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the setup and development of new applications by providing a range of pre-configured features and dependencies.

### What is Java 17?
    Java 17 is a long-term support (LTS) version of the Java programming language, released in September 2021. It includes significant improvements and new features over previous versions, such as enhanced pattern matching, sealed classes, and new APIs for better performance and security. Java 17 is widely used for building modern applications due to its stability and support. 

### What is PostgresSQL?

    PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language. It is known for its robustness, extensibility, and support for advanced data types and performance optimization features. PostgreSQL is widely used for web applications, data warehousing, and other data-intensive applications.


### Tools used:

- Camunda Modeler
- Camunda Platform
- Spring Boot
- Java 17
- Rest API
- PostgresSQL
- Maven

What we are going to build

    We will build a simple Spring Boot application that uses Camunda BPMN to model and execute a business process. The application will include a REST API to interact with the process and a PostgreSQL database to store process data.

How do we achieve this?

1. **Set up the Spring Boot application**: Create a new Spring Boot project with the necessary dependencies for Camunda, PostgreSQL, and REST API.
2. **Model the BPMN process**: Use Camunda Modeler to create a BPMN diagram that defines the business process. This diagram will include tasks, gateways, and events that represent the flow of the process.
3. **Configure Camunda in Spring Boot**: Integrate Camunda into the Spring Boot application by adding the necessary configuration files and dependencies. This will allow the application to execute the BPMN process defined in the modeler.
4. **Implement REST API endpoints**: Create REST API endpoints to start the process, query process instances, and complete tasks. These endpoints
5. **Connect to PostgreSQL**: Configure the application to connect to a PostgreSQL database for storing process data. This will involve setting up the database connection properties and creating the necessary tables.
6. **Run the application**: Start the Spring Boot application and test the REST API endpoints to ensure that the BPMN process can be executed and managed through the API.
7. **Monitor the process**: Use Camunda's built-in monitoring tools to track the execution of the BPMN process, view active instances, and analyze performance metrics.
